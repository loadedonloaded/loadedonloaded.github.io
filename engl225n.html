<h2>Course Description</h2>

<p>Today there appears to be no limit to what computers can do,
		but this has not always been the case. The first electronic digital
		computers of the 1940s, for instance, were little more than exotic
		calculators. They were designed to manipulate alphanumeric symbols, and
		nothing else.
		Computer-generated images, Artificial Intelligence, the World Wide Web:
		all the wondrous affordances of the so-called Digital Age we have
		had to extract, or <i>render visible</i>, from these
		elementary symbol-processing devices.</p>

	<!-- (div id="image2")
	(img src="intimacy.png" id="header")(/div) -->


	<p>This course will introduce students to critical topics at the intersection of
		sexuality and visual culture through a case study of computing. In particular,
		we will focus on the ongoing historical struggle to <i>visual-ize</i>
		computers. How have we managed to derive so many images—and so
		many visions and hopes and fears—from machines that are reducible, at least
		in principle, to meaningless binary digits?

	<p>During the first half of the semester we will examine the relationship between
		computing and vision. What does it mean, for instance, to say that the
		computer is a visual medium?
		How have experts and non-experts visualized the largely in-visible
		mechanisms of computation itself?</p> <!-- And who are the people who have labored
		to make these binary digits visible? -->

	<p>During the second half of the semester we will examine the historical
		relationships between computers, visibility, and sexuality. Why, for
		instance, is the labor of early female computer programmers often described
		as <i>invisible</i> or <i>hidden</i>? How have computers given shape
		to our otherwise shapeless notions of sexuality? How
		has the materiality of sex put flesh to the otherwise
		disembodied processes of computation?

	<p>Overall, this course takes an in-depth look at computers in order to help students grasp
		the complex political and aesthetic stakes surrounding gender, sexuality,
		and technology.</p>

<h2>Assignments + Grading</h2>
 	<p>Final grades will be calculated from a composite of five items throughout the semester:</p>
 	<ul>
                                     <li><button id="bold" class="accordion">
Seminar (20%)
					    </button><div class="panel">
  <p>This course will be conducted in a seminar format, and a high seminar grade
  will reflect regular, attentive, and thoughtful contributions to our discussion.
  Be prepared to ask questions, to respond to other students’ discussion posts, or to make
  claims about the assigned text.</p>
  <p>Discussion, like any other skill, requires time, patience,
  and practice to develop. Everyone is coming to this course with different levels of
  exposure to the course's concepts and with various ranges of experience discussing fictional,
   theoretical, and scholarly texts.
   My only expectation is that everyone will try to keep discussions generative and
  inclusive.</p>
  <p>Students are allowed three absences (the equivalent of one week of class).
   Any absence beyond the third will result in an immediate reduction of the seminar grade.</p>
					     </div></li><li><button id="bold" class="accordion">
Discussion Posts (20%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">
 <p>Throughout the semester students will write eight responses to the assigned readings or films. You may choose which
	 readings and films you will respond to.
 The first three discussion posts must be completed by Week 5,
	 the next three must be completed by Week 10, and the final
  three must be completed by Week 16. Please note that this adds up to nine total responses; I will only be
  grading eight discussion posts, so feel free to skip <i>one</i> as you see fit.</p>
  <p>Each discussion post should be submitted
  by midnight prior to the class for the assigned reading or film (i.e. twelve hours before class meets).
  After midnight the discussion board will lock, and you will no longer be able to add a
   discussion post. When writing your
   discussion post, you may choose either to begin a brand new thread
	  or to respond to a thread already started by a classmate.</p>
 <p>Discussion posts should include any of the following: reflections, questions, close readings; you can discuss
  how a particular text relates to the course as a whole, you can draw comparisons and contrasts
  with prior readings, and you can comment upon your classmates' responses. In order to
  keep the conversation open to your classmates, please refrain from
  discussing media not assigned in this course.</p>
 <p>Each response should include substantive analytic engagement with the assigned reading or film.
  If you ask a question, you should tell us
  <i>why</i> are you asking this question—why, in other words, is it <i>important</i> for us to seek an answer to this question?
  If, alternatively, you want to reflect on an interesting passage, do not simply inform us of your opinion;
  tell us why the text interests you, how it contributes to the themes previously explored throughout the course, etc.
  If, alternatively, you respond to a classmates’ discussion post, be careful not to simply agree or disagree with them;
  you must find a way to build upon what they have already contributed.</p>
 <p>Discussion posts may be brief (~250 words), but
  be prepared to comment upon them at greater length. It is possible that your reading responses will
  be referenced and discussed during class. </p>

                                            </div></li><li><button id="bold" class="accordion">
Reading Quizzes (15%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">
 <p>Reading quizzes will be administered at random throughout the semester. Each quiz will be graded
  on a pass/fail basis. You only need to score 50% or higher to pass. </p>
 <p>Everyone will begin the semester with a quiz grade of “A.” After a first quiz failure, this grade will remain
  unchanged. After a second quiz failure, this grade will be reduced to a “B,” and then, after a third
  failure, to a “C,”  and so on.<p>
 <p>I reserve the right to institute
 regular quizzes if flagging participation indicates that students are not
  keeping up with the readings.</p>

Midterm Essay (20%)
                                            </button><div class="panel">
 	<p>A 5-page analytic essay will be assigned during Week 5 and will be due in my
 	mailbox (430 Burrowes Bldg) by 2pm on October 21, 2019.</p>
	<p>You must complete the midterm essay in order to pass the course.
		A late midterm will receive a grade no higher than "D."</p>

                                    </div></li><li><button id="bold" class="accordion">
Final Essay (25%)

 	<p>A 7-page analytic essay will be assigned during Week 13 and will be due on Canvas by 11:59pm
	 on December 16, 2019.</p>
	 <p>You must complete the final essay in order to pass the course.
		 A late final essay will receive a grade no higher than "D."</p></div></li></ul>

  	<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding these assignments, I will gladly discuss them with you.</p>



<h2>Materials</h2>
 	<p>Please bring the following items to each class:</p>

	<ul><li><i>The assigned reading</i>.
		I do not care if you bring a physical or a so-called digital copy.
		Multiple failures to bring the reading will result in a diminished
		seminar grade.</li><br>
	<li><i>Something to write on; something to write with</i>.
		I don’t care what the utensil is, and I don't
	   	care if the material happens to be scrap paper—I only care that
		you have something you can <i>physically</i> hand in.
		We will not be writing in every class, but please come prepared.</li></ul>

<h2>Nondiscrimination + Accommodations</h2>

		<p>I expect myself and everyone else to maintain a safe classroom environment. Discrimination or harassment of
			any form—and particularly on the basis of race, color, disability status, nationality, sexual and
			gender identity, or religion—will not be tolerated.</p>
 		<p>If you require any acommodations in order to participate in this course, please let me
	 	and/or Penn State's Student Disability Resources office know as soon as possible. It is your
		 right to have these accommodations met.</p>
