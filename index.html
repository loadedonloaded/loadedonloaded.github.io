      The late 1960s and early 1970s were pivotal years in the history of computing technology. But they were also pivotal years for what one contemporary writer called "the technology of computer destruction." The same era that witnessed the dawn of the microelectronics revolution also witnessed the nationwide spread of campus protests, in which activsts routinely occupied and in some cases even bombed university computer centers. While data-processing magazines chronicled feats such as the rise of the ARPANET and the birth of the commercial microprocesser, they also warned of "arson, bombing, invasion"—new terms added to the DP expert's technical vocabulary during what <i>Computerworld</i> dubbed, in 1970, "the year of the crisis."</p>

<p class="bodytext">
      News reports regularly depicted these computer-related protests as crimes of passion. Since computers connoted order and rationality, it seemed that maladjusted students had chosen these machines to vent their disorderly and irrational urges. Upon inspection, however, these computer-related protests exhibit the same two principal causes as the majority of campus protests at the time: the Vietnam War and racial injustice. While issues such as the selective service or Black Studies programs ostensibly had nothing to do with computing, activsts targeted computer centers for tactical, not passionate reasons. On the one hand, computers were identified as instruments of war. Their origins in World War II and their subsequent affinity with classified defense contracts meant that, with the exception of ROTC buildings, computer centers were often the most immediate manifestation of the "military-industrial-academic complex" on campus. On the other hand, computers were vital to the daily operations of many universities—more vital, in some cases, than administration buildings. They were also extremely expensive. Shutting down a computer center halted essential administrative tasks or big-budget research projects, and even a brief occupation could cost the university thousands of dollars in wasted machine time. Students held computers "hostage" while negotiating demands, knowing that administrators would think twice before ordering a police raid or spraying a fire hose if it might risk the integrity of a multi-million dollar computer installation.

        In the late 1960s computers were fulfilling inumerable tasks, of both a quotidian and a highly specialized nature. They processed payroll data, managed airline reservations, and calculated missile trajectories. By collecting the wide range of protest actions at U.S. universities between 1968 and 1971, the following map adds a new dimension to the documented "use" of computing technology in this era. Whether it was through a bombing or a sit-in or a rally, students <i>used</i> computers—and the university's immense ideological and capital investment in computing—to advance agendas of anti-racism, anti-imperialism, and student control of higher education.

Although its creators insisted that Project CAM would develop “neutral computer tools” available to anyone who could afford to plug into its centralized network, the projects and databases posited in their proposal seemed to be tailored toward needs of the Pentagon: “data on youth movements,” “characteristics of Latin American countries since 1810,” “problems of underdeveloped countries and conditions of stability,” “a study of peasant attitudes,” etc.</p><p>In the spring of 1969 members of MIT’s Science Action Coordinating Council discovered the proposal for the project and held a protest on MIT’s campus, warning that Project CAM was effectively a counter-insurgency initiative, using computers and databases to help the DoD suppresses popular movements in foreign countries. By the fall, Project CAM’s base at MIT had received its first $1.5 million grant from ARPA, but Harvard had still not decided whether it would become affiliated with the project. In late September the <i>Harvard Crimson</i> ran a lengthy article placing Project CAM in the context of a prior collaboration between the DoD and the social sciences called Project Camelot. Established in 1964, Project Camelot utilized American social scientists for on-the-ground data collection in countries susceptible to Communist insurgency; when a Chilean-born anthropologist from the University of Pittsburgh was banished from Chile for what appeared to be espionage, Project Camelot was suddenly thrust into national news media, serving as a public and embarrassing example of the porous border between social science research and active counterinsurgency measures. The article in the <i>Crimson</i> framed Project CAM as a revival of Project Camelot, substituting data collection in controversial foreign areas with data manipulation in the comfort of an American computer laboratory. It also suggested that, since “MIT is the Defense Department’s house whore,” Harvard’s participation would seem to legitimize Project CAM as a proper scholarly endeavor.</p><p><img class='image' src='projectcam.jpg'></p><p>In December the Harvard faculty voted against institutional participation in Project CAM.

For instance, the school offered little coursework related to Black history, Black culture, or urban problems, and in 1966 university president James Nabrit had even suggested that the school prioritize admitting more white students. In 1967 Howard students began to voice their dissent with protests, and in March 1968 as many as 2,000 students conducted a 5-day sit-in at the university’s administration building. By the end of the semester the administration agreed to grant students more power in the university’s decision-making apparatus.</p><p>The following school year, however, students expressed their concerns that this agreement had not been fulfilled. Beginning with the university’s professional schools, students began boycotting classes and occupying buildings to demand more control over their coursework. On April 28 a group of sociology and anthropology students began boycotting their classes and seized the office of department chair G. Franklin Edwards, where they issued demands for increased student voting power in department policy decisions as well as coursework relevant to the Black community. They remained in Edwards’s office for a little over a week.</p><p>Meanwhile students continued to occupy more spaces on campus. According to the <i>Washington Post</i>, at one point “almost all major undergraduate buildings were occupied.” On May 2 students conducted a 40-minute “stand-in” at the university’s computer center in Locke Hall, and on May 6 they seized the entire building. At this point all university operations had ground to a halt, and administrators faced the decision of either calling in law enforcement or closing the school. “They know we don’t want to do it (call the police),” Edwards said to the <i>Post</i>, “but the question is how long the university can operate without these facilities.”</p><p>After the students seized the computer center, the administration resolved to call the police. U.S. marshals served a temporary restraining on the occupiers, who had barred the doors of Locke Hall with chains and padlocks and hung a sign outside the building that read: “50 Percent Voting Power or Nothing. We Will Defy TRO [Temporary Restraining Order].” Faced with widespread defiance of the restraining order, university president James Nabrit decided to close the school on May 7.</p><p>On May 8 student occupiers called a news conference and declared that Howard University could no longer be viewed as an educational community separate from the “total Black community.” They demanded that not only students, but the entire Black community have a voice in the university’s administrative procedures.

In a series of exposés, the <i>Daily Cardinal</i> pieced together a network of connections linking the AMRC to direct military applications in Vietnam, including Project Michigan, a massive battlefield surveillance program for rural and dense-brush terrain, which sought to fulfill Robert McNamara’s unrealized dream of an “electronic battlefield.” These disclosures turned AMRC into a regular target of pickets, bomb threats, and other protest actions on a campus that was already deeply committed to anti-war activism.</p><p><img class='image' src='armymath.jpg'></p><p>Apart from the Sir George Williams affair in Montreal, the Sterling Hall bombing was the most momentous student action against a computer center in North America.

The bombing, and the death of Fassnacht in particular, have been regarded as part of a swan song for the American Left.

At 3am the occupiers departed after Chancellor Prosvar signed a statement agreeing to the following terms:</p><p>— the occupiers would not be punished as long as the computers were not damaged.<br>— the university would establish an institute for Black Studies.<br>— a special recruiter approved by the BAS would be assigned to recruit more Black students to Pitt.<br>— a section of the Hillman Library would be established specifically for Black students.<br>— the university would recognize two new holidays: MLK’s birthday, and the anniversary of Malcolm X’s assassination.</p></p><p><img class='image' src='BAS.jpg'></p><p>The occupation proved controversial on campus. Chancellor Prosvar wrote a letter to the student newspaper declaring that BAS’s actions were “dangerous and deplored,” and students spray-painted threats against BAS near their office in the student union. But the Chancellor followed up on the BAS’s demands, and in June the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Council voted to establish a Black Studies Program.</p><p class='hover' onclick='refreshbutton()'>return to list</p></div>"}

The IDA was composed of various divisions ranging from weapons systems to operations research to economic and political analysis. The IDA’s premiere division—the Jason division—comprised nine Princeton physicists, including the chairman of the Jason division, Marvin L. Goldberger.</p><p>Each IDA division was headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, except for the Communications Research Division, which leased Von Neumann Hall—along with two Control Data Corporation 1604 and 160 computers—on Princeton’s campus. The Communication Research Division studied  “specialized problems of communications” such as cryptography, “with particular emphasis on mathematical foundations and computer applications.” The director of Princeton’s computer center also noted that the IDA was “of tremendous importance” in the establishment of Princeton’s computer science program in the early 1960s. Although the Communications Research Division was not technically under the jurisdiction of Princeton, its lease of Von Neumann Hall lasted through 1975.</p><p>Students and faculty immediately expressed their disapproval of IDA presence on campus. Princeton’s Students for a Democratic Society sent a letter to University President Robert Goheen demanding that the university sever ties with the IDA and relocate the Communications Research Division. President Goheen rejected these demands, and on the morning of October 23 SDS members expressed their dissent by blockading the entrance to Von Neumann Hall. The demonstrators were forcibly removed by police, and 31 were arrested.</p><p><img class='image' src='princeton1.png'></p><p>This marked the beginning of a series of protest actions against the IDA over the next six years. On April 23, 1969 multiple fistfights broke out between IDA employees and SDS members when they barred entrance once again. In one of the scuffles, an IDA employee punched Princeton’s Dean of Students in the face and knocked him onto the ground. Demonstrations occurred into the fall, with blockades staged on November 13 and November 18.</p><p>On May 6, 1970—two days after the Kent State massacre—900 demonstrators broke through the locked gate surrounding Von Neumann Hall and picketed for two and a half hours. That night, 250 students slept outside of the building and refused to let IDA employees enter the next day. The top headline of that morning’s <i>Princetonian</i> read, “Strikers besiege IDA: Computer halted.” According to the paper, each hour that the computer was not in use had a “retail value” of $1,000. The siege lasted 100 hours, until the afternoon of May 11, when police served a restraining order and evicted 300 protesters from the premises. Around 2:25am on May 12, a Princeton student started a fire at Von Neumann Hall’s outside air conditioning unit, with the possible intent of forcing the building's computers to overheat. The student was arrested and charged with arson, and the fire was extinguished before it caused any serious damage.</p><p><img class='image' src='princeton2.png'></p><p>After the siege President Goheen began taking active steps to relocate the Communications Research Division from Von Neumann Hall before its lease expired in 1975. However, proposed plans consistently encountered cost and contract limitations. For instance, it was estimated that Princeton would have to pay the IDA $500,000 in moving expenses.</p><p>In May 1972, President Nixon announced the mining and blockading of the North Vietnamese coast. Anti-war demonstrations on Princeton’s campus led yet again to the blockading of Von Neumann Hall. Between May 10 and May 14 a total of 131 students and faculty were arrested, as well as 57 individuals and students from college campuses across the northeastern United States.</p><p><img class='image' src='princeton3.png'></p><p>After this—“the largest case of civil disobedience in Princeton’s history” at the time—the IDA began to actively seek and develop plans for building a new site off of Princeton’s campus. However, due to issues of cost and pushback from local residents, these plans never materialized. The Communications and Research Division did not leave Von Neumann Hall until its least expired in 1975.</p><p class='hover' onclick='refreshbutton()'>return to list</p></div>"}

Keegan failed to respond to these demands by a November 12 deadline, and on November 17 members of the USI began a sit-in at the Arts and Sciences Building, requesting that the students and faculty hold an immediate vote on their 41 demands, and that the results of the vote be binding on the administration.</p><p>The following day 20 USI members occupied and locked themselves into the campus data-processing center. Between 20 and 40 additional members of the USI demonstrated outside the door. The data-processing center contained a UNIVAC 9200 and was used primarily for administrative tasks such as payroll, grade entry, and tuition book-keeping. According to its director, there were no backup files available outside the center.</p><p>The Salem State administration refused to discuss the USI’s demands until the occupiers left the center. On November 19 a mass gathering of students voted in favor of asking the occupiers to vacate, and all but 4 of the occupiers obliged. On November 22 news reports from the <i>Boston Globe</i> suggested that the remaining occupiers were reaching a deal with the administration, and on November 24 the final 4 students left on the condition that discussion of “campus issues” would begin.</p><p class='hover' onclick='refreshbutton()'>return to list</p></div>"}

On October 8, after a series of meetings and an exchange of signed statements detailing specific instances of racism and paternalism from specific coaches, the IAC voted to drop the charges against the athletic department and continue “discussion and investigation” into charges about rapport, representation, and traveling to segregationist areas.</p><p>This failure to respond prompted the computer center takeover. According to one of the occupiers, North Hall “had a strategic advantage in that it housed the only major computer on campus. We wanted to have something in which there was a stake, and we believed that the administration would not want to give up the computer or would be a little reluctant to compromise it.” After occupying the building, the BSU demanded the development of a Black Studies program, a commission to investigate racial problems on campus, a community relations staff, the hiring of a Black female counselor, the appointment of Black coaches, a statement against student harassment, as well as the firing of the Athletic Director and the head of the Physical Activities department.</p><p><img class='image' src='ucsb2.png'></p><p>The students were offered one hour to vacate North Hall with no consequences, but they refused. The building was surrounded by a small group of police officers and a crowd of supporters and counter-protesters that steadily grew to number 1,000 people. Eventually, Chancellor Vernon Cheadle agreed to all the BSU’s demands except for the firing of the Athletic Director and the head of the PA department. At 6pm the occupiers left the building and were punished with a “suspended suspension.”</p><p>Editorials and letters to the editor of <i>El Gaucho</i> in subsequent days reflected intense polarization regarding the occupation, and strong resentment against the BSU on the part of white students: </p><p><img class='image' src='ucsb.png'></p><p>However, as one faculty member later recalled, the administration acted “almost immediately” upon the demand for curricular change, and UCSB established its Black Studies department and a Black Studies Center in 1969.</p><p class='hover' onclick='refreshbutton()'>return to list</p></div>"}

The previous day the <i>Stanford Daily</i> had published a story under the headline, “Complicity with Military-Industrial Complex,” which accused the Stanford Research Institute of war gaming at Stanford’s Computation Center. The story focused in particular on SRI researcher Andrew Grant, whose study, “Amphibious Assault Logistics,” used a program called GAMUT-H to optimize helicopter operations in amphibious terrain.</p><p>On February 10 over 500 strikers attended a noon rally at Stanford’s White Plaza, where several speakers addressed the crowd on community relations and university-military disruption. The final and longest speech was delivered by English professor H. Bruce Franklin, a member of the radical group Venceremos and a known Marxist activist, who ended his speech by saying:</p><p>“See, now what we’re asking is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show that we’re willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation Center.” </p><p><img class='image' src='stanford2.png'></p><p>After a vote, 300 protesters left White Plaza and traveled to Pine Hall, home of the Computation Center, where they found a sign that read: “Sorry, Computer Center Temporarily Closed.” Demonstrators forced their way into the building, where they confronted staff members and researchers and then cut the power supply to the machines. Soon, members of the Santa Clara County Sheriffs Department arrived and declared it an illegal assembly. The demonstrators agreed to leave when they received a written statement or public announcement from Stanford President Richard Lyman that the Computer Center would no longer be used for military research. The associate provost insisted that the SRI’s contracts had already been terminated on the same day that the GAMUT-H story appeared in the <i>Stanford Daily</i>, but the students were skeptical and they refused to leave. At around 4pm riot police descended on the building, driving the demonstrators from the premises. Police caught and beat several protesters. Overall the occupiers caused $1,000 worth of damage to the $5 million Computation Center, and virtually no damage to the computers at all.</p><p><img class='image' src='stanford1.png'></p><p>On February 13 the <i>Stanford Daily</i> ran a special Saturday issue to announce that President Lyman had suspended professor Franklin for his role in the occupation. After a series of prolonged hearings in October, a special university advisory board found that Franklin had intentionally urged and incited the computer center occupation, and that he had encouraged students to resist the police dispersal order.

The protesters xeroxed the documents and then later disclosed a number of military-funded research contracts on campus. In an atmosphere of heightened attention to military funding, Stony Brook’s research coordinator Donald Ackerman later released information regarding a proposal submitted by several Stony Brook professors to Project THEMIS, a Department of Defense initiative to expand DoD funding into small and mid-level universities that were trying to establish themselves as research institutions. Project THEMIS had an explicit quid-pro-quo policy, helping to establish research centers as long as these centers addressed clear defense problems. The Stony Brook proposal to Project THEMIS, which requested $400,000, was titled “Computer Aids to Decision Making.”</p><p>On April 21 local SDS leaders presented university president John Toll with a 1300-signature petition in opposition to the Project THEMIS proposal. The petition contained three demands: the university must terminate all DoD and NASA contracts immediately; it must ban all recruiters from the military as well as a corporations involved in Third World exploitation; and it must cancel a planned $150 increase in dormitory fees. Three days later president Toll officially rejected these demands at an SDS rally.</p><p>On May 8 SDS held a rally on the library mall, where an SDS leader told 300 demonstrators: “We’ve tried petitions—with up to 15000 signatures; we tried face-to-face discussion with Dr. Toll—individually and collectively. We’ve had peaceful rallies and peaceful pickets. All these things are considered legitimate channels and they haven’t worked.” Another SDS leader announced that a group of students had occupied the Computing Center, and the demonstrators marched to join them. At 4pm approximately 120 protesters had entered the building and chained the doors shut. At 6:30 President Toll initiated procedures to acquire a restraining order, and at 7:45 the occupiers vacated the building before the restraining order could be served.

By 1971 the DoD had allocated no new funds for Project THEMIS in the upcoming fiscal year.

When the Labor Committee found that only 2 of 80 total workers were Black, they partnered with the United Community Construction Workers and the New Urban League to draft a list of demands for the Tufts administration, including 20% minority representation—equivalent to the minority population of the surrounding area—among the workers, aggressive recruitment of Black sub-contractors, special plans to monitor the hiring and treatment of Black workers, and further discussions on affirmative action for future construction projects. The AAS submitted these demands on October 20 and demanded full implementation within two weeks.</p><p>Although the administration deemed the demands “reasonable,” they would not abide by the time limit. On November 3, the deadline set by AAS, the university initiated legal proceedings against its contractor, Volpe Construction Company, seeking a declaratory judgment on parts of its contract. The university was attempting to side with the AAS by investigating the contractor’s hiring practices, but the AAS rejected these measures as an “illusion of political pressure” and re-affirmed its demand that the administration suspend payment to Volpe until its hiring practices changed.

Administrators proposal a temporary solution, in which the university administration would hire minority workers until it could persuade Volpe to hire them, but the AAS rejected the proposal since it did not guarantee employment on the site.

According to the <i>Daily Illini</i>, the $24 million computer would dedicate two-thirds of its time to Department of Defense research and would “play a vital role in the development of more sophisticated nuclear weaponry.” The project director, computer scientist Daniel Slotnick, was quoted as saying that the computer’s unprecedented size would enable “vastly more horrible and powerful weapons systems by creating a body of scientific knowledge for such weapons systems.”</p><p>On February 18 a group of 20 students held a silent vigil at the Illiac IV construction site to protest its development as well as the violence in Vietnam. This marked the first of several small demonstrations over the following months. The next day 100 students and faculty attended an Illiac IV teach-in sponsored by Faculty for University Reform.
